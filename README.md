# Calculus Library  
### building module to serve as backend for symbolic mathematics application.

A project that has been attracting my interest is building a calculus module to support the backend of a symbolic mathematics application. Think Wolfram Alpha. No, I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or do anything innovative, I just think it will be a fun exercise. Sure calculus is pretty easy, but coding it takes some care.
